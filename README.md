A game I made with PyGame a while ago

In the game, you drive a speeding car on a highway. You dodge cars by pressing the arrow keys or A and D on your keyboard. Your car slowly speeds up adding difficulty to the game.

The game has also a menu page with different subpages.

The graphics in the game are by me. The background music is by Eric Matyas (www.soundimage.org) and the car honk sound effect (activated in the game by pressing H) is by Sound Jay (www.soundjay.com).
